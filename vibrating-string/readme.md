This is an extention to an assignment given in a Numerical Algorithms course. The goal was to solve the partial differential equation for a (1-dimensional) string. Formally speaking, d^2u / dx^2 = d^2u/dt^2 , where u(x, t) is a function of position and time (for a somewhat nicer view of the equation, see the html). The boundary conditions are u(0, t) = u(1, t) = 0 (fixed ends of the string of unit length), and the initial conditions are u(x, 0) = f(x), where for this problem, f(x) = x (0 < x =< 0.5) or 1-x (0.5 < x < 1) (that is, the string is being plucked, and then released). The solution was gotten by discretizing the equation. The discretization creates a "mesh" of points, with h being the width of the discrete position intervals, and k - the width of the discrete time intervals. These values can be changed in the app by changing the values in the appropriate input fields. The app creates a table for the y-positions at all mesh points. The table is then populated, left to right position, early to late time. Finally, depending on the position of the slider, the corresponding plot of the string is displayed. 

The mathematical calculations behind this visualization were done in Javascript, and then visualized using the D3.js library.
